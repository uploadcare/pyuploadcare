# History

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.0.1](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1) - unreleased

### Fixed

- The SSL context is now cached by default, resulting in significant performance improvements when initializing the `Uploadcare` class frequently.  [#279](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/issues/279)

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.3.0...v5.0.0) - 2023-12-28

In version 5.0, we introduce a new [file uploader](https://uploadcare.com/docs/file-uploader/), which is now the default for Django projects. If you prefer to continue using the old jQuery-based widget, you can enable it by setting the `use_legacy_widget` option in your configuration:

```python
UPLOADCARE = {
    ...,
    "use_legacy_widget": True,
    "legacy_widget": {
        "version": "3.x",
    }
}
```

Additionally, please take note that some settings have been renamed in this update (see the next section).

### Breaking Changes

- Python 3.6 and 3.7 are no longer supported.
- Django 1.11, 2.0, and 2.1 are no longer supported.
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) has been updated to Version 2. Projects dependent on Pydantic Version 1 may encounter errors due to incompatibility between Versions 1 and 2.
- Removed `tox.ini`. The recommended method for running tests locally is now through [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) with Docker.

- for Django settings (`UPLOADCARE = {...}`):
  - `widget_*` settings were renamed and moved:
    - `UPLOADCARE["widget_version"]` to `UPLOADCARE["legacy_widget"]["version"]`
    - `UPLOADCARE["widget_build"]` to `UPLOADCARE["legacy_widget"]["build"]`
    - `UPLOADCARE["widget_variant"]` to `UPLOADCARE["legacy_widget"]["build"]` (this is not a typo: former `widget_build` and `widget_variant` settings were equialent)
    - `UPLOADCARE["widget_url"]` to `UPLOADCARE["legacy_widget"]["override_js_url"]` and works regardless of `use_hosted_assets` value.

- for `pyuploadcare.dj.conf`:
  - Individual variables were moved into one dict called `config`. If you've accessed these settings from `pyuploadcare.dj.conf` module in your code, please migrate:
    - `pub_key` to `config["pub_key"]`
    - `secret` to `config["secret"]`
    - `cdn_base` to `config["cdn_base"]`
    - `upload_base_url` to `config["upload_base_url"]`
    - `use_hosted_assets` to `config["use_hosted_assets"]`
    - `widget_version` to `config["legacy_widget"]["version"]`
    - `widget_build` to `config["legacy_widget"]["build"]`
    - `uploadcare_js` to `get_legacy_widget_js_url()`
  - Gone from `pyuploadcare.dj.conf`:
    - `widget_filename`
    - `hosted_url`
    - `local_url`

- for `pyuploadcare.dj.forms`:
  - `FileWidget` renamed to `LegacyFileWidget`. `FileWidget` is an all-new implementation now.
  - By default, `FileWidget` is used. To use `LegacyFileWidget`, please set `UPLOADCARE["use_legacy_widget"]` to `True`

### Added

- Added Python 3.12 and Django 5.0 to the test matrix.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies: `httpx`, `pydantic`, `pytz`, `typing-extensions`.
- Updated development dependencies: `mypy`, `pytest`, `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `flake8-print`, `vcrpy`, `yarl`, `coverage`, `pytest-cov`, `sphinx`, `sphinx-argparse`, `types-*`. Replaced `pytest-freezegun` with `pytest-freezer`.

## [4.3.0](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.2.2...v4.3.0) - 2023-12-24

### Fixed

- For `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithAclToken` and `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithUrlToken`:
  - Special characters that were not previously escaped are now properly handled, as detailed in issue [#275](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/issues/275).

### Changed

- For `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithAclToken` and `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithUrlToken`:
  - Both classes have been made more consistent and now accept a full URL, URL path, or just the UUID of a file â€“ whichever is more convenient for you.

### Deprecated

- For `FileGroup`:
  - Added a deprecation warning when accessing `datetime_stored` property, as it has been deprecated in the REST API. This field does not exist in REST API v0.7.x.

- For `GroupsAPI`:
  - Added a deprecation warning when calling `store` method, as it has been deprecated in the REST API. This API endpoint does not exist in REST API v0.7.x.

## [4.2.2](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.2.1...v4.2.2) - 2023-11-20

### Added

- For `File`:
  - AWS Rekognition Moderation results are now accessible via `File.info["appdata"]["aws_rekognition_detect_moderation_labels"]`.

## [4.2.1](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1) - 2023-11-17

### Fixed

- For `AddonsAPI`:
  - In version 4.2.0, passing a Python dictionary as `params` to the `execute` method would cause an `AttributeError`. Now, you can use either an `AddonExecutionParams` instance or a `dict`.

## [4.2.0](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.1.3...v4.2.0) - 2023-11-16

Summary of this update:

1. Added support for the `save_in_group` parameter in [multipage conversion](https://uploadcare.com/docs/transformations/document-conversion/#multipage-conversion) (#258);
2. Implemented the [AWS Rekognition Moderation](https://uploadcare.com/docs/unsafe-content/) addon API (#260);
3. Added `signed_uploads` setting for Django projects (#262);
4. Secure URL generation improvements (#263 & #264);
5. Various bug fixes.

There are no breaking changes in this release.

### Added

- For `Uploadcare`:
  - Added a type for the `event` parameter of the `create_webhook` and `update_webhook` methods.
  - Added the `generate_upload_signature` method. This shortcut could be useful for signed uploads from your website's frontend, where the signature needs to be passed outside of your website's Python part (e.g., for the uploading widget).
  - Added `generate_secure_url_token` method. Similar to `generate_secure_url`, it returns only a token, not the full URL.
  - Added an optional `wildcard` parameter to the `generate_secure_url` method.

- For `File`:
  - Added the `save_in_group` parameter to the `convert` and `convert_document` methods. It defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, multi-page documents will additionally be saved as a file group.
  - Added the `get_converted_document_group` method. It returns a `FileGroup` instance for converted multi-page documents.

- For `DocumentConvertAPI`:
  - Added the `retrieve` method, which corresponds to the [`GET /convert/document/:uuid/`](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/rest-api/v0.7.0/#tag/Conversion/operation/documentConvertInfo) API endpoint.

- For `AddonsAPI` / `AddonLabels`:
  - Added support for the [Unsafe content detection](https://uploadcare.com/docs/unsafe-content/) addon (`AddonLabels.AWS_MODERATION_LABELS`).

- For Django integration:
  - Added the `signed_uploads` setting for Django projects. When enabled, this setting exposes the generated signature to the uploading widget.

- For `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithAclToken`:
  - Added `get_token` method.
  - Added an optional `wildcard` parameter to the `build` method.

- Introduced `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithUrlToken` class.

### Changed

- `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilder` has been renamed to `AkamaiSecureUrlBuilderWithAclToken`. It is still available under the old name and works as before, but it will issue a deprecation warning when used.

### Fixed

- For `AddonsAPI` / `AddonExecutionParams`:
  - Fixed an issue where calling `execute` and `status` with `AddonLabels`'s attributes (such as `AddonLabels.REMOVE_BG`) for the `addon_name` would result in a _404 Not Found_ error.
  - Fixed `ValidationError` when constructing `AddonClamAVExecutionParams` or `AddonRemoveBGExecutionParams` with omitted optional parameters.

## [4.1.3](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.1.2...v4.1.3) - 2023-10-05

### Added

## [4.1.2](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2) - 2023-09-08

### Fixed

- Incorrect expiration time was calculated for signed uploads causing the `AuthenticationError: Expired signature` exception.

## [4.1.1](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1) - 2023-09-04

### Fixed

- Resolved a `ValidationError` that occurred when requesting file information for specific video files.

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0) - 2023-07-18

### Added

- For `Uploadcare` and `UploadAPI`:
  - `upload_from_url` and `upload_from_url_sync` can now accept two new optional parameters: `check_duplicates` and `save_duplicates`. These correspond to `check_URL_duplicates` and `save_URL_duplicates` for [`/from_url/` upload API endpoint](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/upload-api/#tag/Upload/operation/fromURLUpload) respectively.
- For `FileGroup`:
  - The `delete` method now includes an optional `delete_files` argument, which indicates whether the files within the specified group should also be deleted.

### Changed

- Bumped `httpx` dependency for py37+.
- Bumped `yarl` dev dependency for py37+.
- Bumped `coverage` dev dependency for py37+.
- Tests are now run against Python 3.11 as well. The minimum supported version of Python remains 3.6.

Now uses [REST API v0.7](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/rest-api/v0.7.0/#tag/Changelog).

### Breaking changes

- For `File.info`:
  - File information doesn't return `image_info` and `video_info` fields anymore,
  they were moved into field `content_info` that includes mime-type, image (dimensions, format, etc), video information (duration, format, bitrate, etc), audio information, etc.
  - Removed `rekognition_info` in favor of `appdata`.
- For `file_list` method of `FileList`:
  - Removed the option of sorting the file list by file size.
- For `File`:
  - Removed method `copy` in favor of `local_copy` and `remote_copy` methods.
  - Files to upload must be opened in a binary mode.

### Added

- For `File.info`:
  - Field `metadata` that includes arbitrary metadata associated with a file.
  - Field `appdata` that includes dictionary of application names and data associated with these applications.
- Add Uploadcare API interfaces for `Uploadcare`:
    - `MetadataAPI`
    - `AddonsAPI`
- Added an option to delete a Group.

### Fixed

  - Limit for batch operation is set to 100 [(doc)](https://uploadcare.com/api-refs/rest-api/v0.7.0/#operation/filesStoring).

unicode and `requests.request()` got `files` argument, e.g.:

``` python
>>> requests.request(u'post', u'http://httpbin.org/post',

    `your_model_form.is_valid()`. There is other thing that can trigger
    storing -- calling `photo.full_clean()` directly.
