- Default API version was updated up to *0.3*.
- Django settings were merged into UPLOADCARE dictionary.
- Performance was improved by reusing requests' session.

1.0.2
~~~~~

``UnicodeDecodeError`` was fixed. This bug appears when
`request <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/>`_'s ``method``
param is unicode and ``requests.request()`` got ``files`` argument, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> requests.request(u'post', u'http://httpbin.org/post',
    ...                  files={u'file': open('README.rst', 'rb')})
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc5 ...

1.0.1
~~~~~

- Widget was updated up to *0.8.1.2*.
- It was invoking ``File.store()``, ``FileGroup.store()`` methods on every
  model instance saving, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: python

      photo.title = 'new title'
      photo.save()

  Now it happens while saving by form, namely by calling
  ``your_model_form.is_valid()``. There is other thing that can trigger
  storing -- calling ``photo.full_clean()`` directly.

~~~

- Python 3.2, 3.3 support were added.
