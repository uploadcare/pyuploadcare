pip install pyuploadcare[django]
```

## Usage example

Let's add [File Uploader](https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/storage/#file-storing-behavior) to an existing Django project. To do so, follow a few simple steps described in our [quickstart](https://pyuploadcare.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html).

This will enable users to see the upload progress, pick files from sources like Google Drive or Instagram, and edit a form while files are being uploaded asynchronously.

```python
    from django import forms
    from django.db import models

    from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField
    from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import FileWidget, ImageField as ImageFormField


    class Candidate(models.Model):
        photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")


    # optional. provide advanced widget options: https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/widget/config/#options
    class CandidateForm(forms.Form):
        photo = ImageFormField(widget=FileWidget(attrs={
            'data-cdn-base': 'https://cdn.super-candidates.com',
            'data-image-shrink': '1024x1024',
        }))
```
