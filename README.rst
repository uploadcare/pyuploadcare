Simple file uploads for the web are of most importance
for us at `Uploadcare`_. Today, everyone is used to the routine of
allowing users to upload their pics or attach resumes. The routine
covers it all: installing image processing libraries, adjusting permissions,
ensuring servers never go down, and enabling CDN.
Features like uploading from Facebook or manual crop are weighty,
hence rare.
Our goal is to change the status quo.

This library consists of the `Uploadcare`_ API interface and a couple
of Django goodies. You might also want to check out this `guide`_ as
a starting point.

Simple as that, Uploadcare ``ImageField`` can be added to an
existing Django project in just a couple of `simple steps`_.
This will enable your users to see the upload progress, pick files
from Google Drive or Instagram, and edit a form while files are
being uploaded asynchronously.

.. code-block:: python

    from django import forms
    from django.db import models

    from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField
    from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import FileWidget


    class Candidate(models.Model):
        photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")


    # optional. provide advanced widget options: https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/widget/config/#options
    class CandidateForm(forms.Form):
        photo = ImageField(widget=FileWidget(attrs={
            'data-cdn-base': 'https://cdn.super-candidates.com',
            'data-image-shrink': '1024x1024',
        }))

Features
========

- Python wrapper for Uploadcare `REST`_ and `Upload`_ APIs.
- Django widget with useful manual crop and multi-upload.
- *ucare* console utility.
- hosted assets (Kudos to `SÅ‚awek Ehlert`_!).

Requirements
============

``pyuploadcare`` requires Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.

To use ``pyuploadcare`` with Python 2.7 please install ``pyuploadcare < 3.0``.

If you're using ``pyuploadcare`` with Django, check ``tox.ini``  or
``.github/workflows``  for supported Python-Django combinations.

Obsolete versions of Python and Django are officially not supported, but chances
are that everything still works. If you have to use those, modify ``tox.ini``,
test and run at your own risk ;) Or, you may use older versions of the library.

Installation
============

In order to install ``pyuploadcare``, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyuploadcare

or, if you prefer it the old way:

.. code-block:: console

    $ easy_install pyuploadcare

To use in Django project install with extra dependencies::

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyuploadcare[django]

Usage
=====

Core API
--------

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use pyuploadcare in any Python project. You need to pass
your project keys to ``Uploadcare`` client::

    from pyuploadcare import Uploadcare
    uploadcare = Uploadcare(public_key='<your public key>', secret_key='<your private key>')

Uploading files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upload single file. ``File.upload`` method can accept file object or URL. Depending of file object size
direct or multipart upload method will be chosen::

    with open('file.txt') as file_object:
        ucare_file: File = uploadcare.upload(file_object)


Upload file from url::

    ucare_file: File = uploadcare.upload("https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png")

Upload multiple files. Direct upload method is used::

    file1 = open('file1.txt')
    file2 = open('file2.txt')
    ucare_files: List[File] = uploadcare.upload_files([file1, file2])

Send single file via multipart upload::

    with open('file.txt') as file_object:
        ucare_file: File = uploadcare.upload(file_object)

``Uploadcare.upload`` method accepts optional callback function to track uploading progress.
Example of using callback function for printing progress::

    >>> def print_progress(info: UploadProgress):
    ...     print(f'{info.done}/{info.total} B')

    >>> # multipart upload is used
    >>> with open('big_file.jpg', 'rb') as fh:
    ...    uploadcare.upload(fh, callback=print_progress)
    0/11000000 B
    5242880/11000000 B
    10485760/11000000 B
    11000000/11000000 B

    >>> # upload from url is used
    >>> uploadcare.upload("https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png", callback=print_progress)
    32590/32590 B

    >>> # direct upload is used. Callback is called just once after successful upload
    >>> with open('small_file.jpg', 'rb') as fh:
    ...     uploadcare.upload(fh, callback=print_progress)
    56780/56780 B


List files
^^^^^^^^^^

Get list of files::

    files: FileList = uploadcare.list_files(stored=True, limit=10)
    for file in files:
        print(file.info)

Retrieve files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get existing file::

    file: File = uploadcare.file("740e1b8c-1ad8-4324-b7ec-112c79d8eac2")
    print(file.info)

Store files
^^^^^^^^^^^

Store single file::

    file: File = uploadcare.file("740e1b8c-1ad8-4324-b7ec-112c79d8eac2")
    file.store()

Store multiple files::

    files = [
        '6c5e9526-b0fe-4739-8975-72e8d5ee6342',
        'a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b'
    ]
    uploadcare.store_files(files)

Delete files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delete single file::

    file: File = uploadcare.file("740e1b8c-1ad8-4324-b7ec-112c79d8eac2")
    file.delete()

Delete multiple files::

    files = [
        '6c5e9526-b0fe-4739-8975-72e8d5ee6342',
        'a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b'
    ]
    uploadcare.delete_files(files)

Video conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uploadcare can encode video files from all popular formats, adjust their quality, format and dimensions, cut out a video fragment, and generate thumbnails via REST API.

After each video file upload you obtain a file identifier in UUID format. Then you can use this file identifier to convert your video in multiple ways::

    file = uploadcare.file('740e1b8c-1ad8-4324-b7ec-112c79d8eac2')
    transformation = (
        VideoTransformation()
            .format(Format.mp4)
            .size(width=640, height=480, resize_mode=ResizeMode.add_padding)
            .quality(Quality.lighter)
            .cut(start_time='2:30.535', length='2:20.0')
            .thumbs(10)
    )
    converted_file: File = file.convert(transformation)

or you can use API directly to convert single or multiple files::

    transformation = VideoTransformation().format(VideoFormat.webm).thumbs(2)
    paths: List[str] = [
        transformation.path("740e1b8c-1ad8-4324-b7ec-112c79d8eac2"),
    ]

    response = uploadcare.video_convert_api.convert(paths)
    video_convert_info = response.result[0]
    converted_file = uploadcare.file(video_convert_info.uuid)

    video_convert_status = uploadcare.video_convert_api.status(video_convert_info.token)

Document Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uploadcare allows converting documents to the following target formats: doc, docx, xls, xlsx, odt, ods, rtf, txt, pdf, jpg, png. Document Conversion works via our REST API.

After each document file upload you obtain a file identifier in UUID format. Then you can use this file identifier to convert your document to a new format::

    file = uploadcare.file('0e1cac48-1296-417f-9e7f-9bf13e330dcf')
    transformation = DocumentTransformation().format(DocumentFormat.pdf)
    converted_file: File = file.convert(transformation)

or create an image of a particular page (if using image format)::

    file = uploadcare.file('5dddafa0-a742-4a51-ac40-ae491201ff97')
    transformation = DocumentTransformation().format(DocumentFormat.png).page(1)
    converted_file: File = file.convert(transformation)

or you can use API directly to convert single or multiple files::

    transformation = DocumentTransformation().format(DocumentFormat.pdf)

    paths: List[str] = [
        transformation.path("0e1cac48-1296-417f-9e7f-9bf13e330dcf"),
    ]

    response = uploadcare.document_convert_api.convert([path])
    document_convert_info = response.result[0]
    converted_file = uploadcare.file(document_convert_info.uuid)

    document_convert_status = uploadcare.document_convert_api.status(document_convert_info.token)


Image transformations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uploadcare allows to apply image transformations to files. ``File.cdn_url`` attribute returns CDN url::

    >>> file_ = File('a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b')
    >>> file_.cdn_url
    https://ucarecdn.com/a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b/

You can set default effects by string::

    >>> file_.set_effects('effect/flip/-/effect/mirror/')
    >>> file_.cdn_url
    https://ucarecdn.com/a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b/-/effect/flip/-/effect/mirror/

or by image transformation builder::

    >>> file_.set_effects(ImageTransformation().grayscale().flip())
    >>> file_.cdn_url
    https://ucarecdn.com/a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b/-/grayscale/-/flip/

Create file group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create file group::

    file_1: File = uploadcare.file('6c5e9526-b0fe-4739-8975-72e8d5ee6342')
    file_2: File = uploadcare.file('a771f854-c2cb-408a-8c36-71af77811f3b')
    file_group: FileGroup = uploadcare.create_file_group([file_1, file_2])


Retreive file group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get file group::

    file_group: FileGroup = uploadcare.file_group('0513dda0-582f-447d-846f-096e5df9e2bb~2')
    print(file_group.info())

Store file group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stores all group's files::

    file_group: FileGroup = uploadcare.file_group('0513dda0-582f-447d-846f-096e5df9e2bb~2')
    file_group.store()

List file groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List file groups::

    file_groups: List[FileGroup] = uploadcare.list_file_groups(limit=10)
    for file_group in file_groups:
        print(file_group.info)


Create webhook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create webhook::

    webhook: Webhook = uploadcare.create_webhook("https://path/to/webhook")

List webhooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List webhooks::

    webhooks: List[Webhook] = list(uploadcare.list_webhooks(limit=10))

Update webhook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update webhook::

    webhook: Webhook = uploadcare.update_webhook(webhook_id, is_active=False)

Delete webhook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Delete webhook::

    uploadcare.delete_webhook(webhook_id)


Get project info
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get project info::

    project_info: ProjectInfo = uploadcare.get_project_info()


Secure delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use your own custom domain and CDN provider for deliver files with authenticated URLs (see original documentation).

Generate secure for file::

    from pyuploadcare import Uploadcare
    from pyuploadcare.secure_url import AkamaiSecureUrlBuilder

    secure_url_bulder = AkamaiSecureUrlBuilder("your cdn>", "<your secret for token generation>")

    uploadcare = Uploadcare(
        public_key='<your public key>',
        secret_key='<your private key>',
        secure_url_builder=secure_url_bulder,
    )

    secure_url = uploadcare.generate_secure_url('52da3bfc-7cd8-4861-8b05-126fef7a6994')

Generate secure for file with transformations::

    secure_url = uploadcare.generate_secure_url(
        '52da3bfc-7cd8-4861-8b05-126fef7a6994/-/resize/640x/other/transformations/'
    )
