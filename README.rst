Simple file uploads for the web are of most importance
for us at `Uploadcare`_. Today, everyone is used to the routine of
allowing users to upload their pics or attach resumes. The routine
covers it all: installing image processing libraries, adjusting permissions,
ensuring servers never go down, and enabling CDN.
Features like uploading from Facebook or manual crop are weighty,
hence rare.
Our goal is to change the status quo.

This library consists of the `Uploadcare`_ API interface and a couple
of Django goodies.

Simple as that, Uploadcare ``ImageField`` can be added to an
existing Django project in just a couple of `simple steps`_.
This will enable your users to see the upload progress, pick files
from Google Drive or Instagram, and edit a form while files are
being uploaded asynchronously.

.. code-block:: python

    from django import forms
    from django.db import models

    from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField
    from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import FileWidget


    class Candidate(models.Model):
        photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")


    # optional. provide advanced widget options: https://uploadcare.com/documentation/widget/#configuration
    class CandidateForm(forms.Form):
        photo = ImageField(widget=FileWidget(attrs={
            'data-cdn-base': 'https://cdn.super-candidates.com',
            'data-image-shrink': '1024x1024',
        }))
