Simple file uploads for the web are of most importance
for us at `Uploadcare`_. Today, everyone is used to the routine of
allowing users to upload their pics or attach resumes. The routine
covers it all: installing image processing libraries, adjusting permissions,
ensuring servers never go down, and enabling CDN.
Features like uploading from Facebook or manual crop are weighty,
hence rare.
Our goal is to change the status quo.

This library consists of the `Uploadcare`_ API interface and a couple
of Django goodies. You might also want to check out this `guide`_ as
a starting point.

Simple as that, Uploadcare ``ImageField`` can be added to an
existing Django project in just a couple of `simple steps`_.
This will enable your users to see the upload progress, pick files
from Google Drive or Instagram, and edit a form while files are
being uploaded asynchronously.

.. code-block:: python

    from django import forms
    from django.db import models

    from pyuploadcare.dj.models import ImageField
    from pyuploadcare.dj.forms import FileWidget


    class Candidate(models.Model):
        photo = ImageField(blank=True, manual_crop="")


    # optional. provide advanced widget options: https://uploadcare.com/docs/uploads/widget/config/#options
    class CandidateForm(forms.Form):
        photo = ImageField(widget=FileWidget(attrs={
            'data-cdn-base': 'https://cdn.super-candidates.com',
            'data-image-shrink': '1024x1024',
        }))

Features
--------

- Python wrapper for Uploadcare `REST`_ and `Upload`_ APIs.
- Django widget with useful manual crop and multi-upload.
- *ucare* console utility.
- hosted assets (Kudos to `Sławek Ehlert`_!).

Requirements
------------

``pyuploadcare`` requires Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.

To use ``pyuploadcare`` with Python 2.7 please install ``pyuploadcare < 3.0``.

If you're using ``pyuploadcare`` with Django, check ``tox.ini``  or
``.github/workflows``  for supported Python-Django combinations.

Obsolete versions of Python and Django are officially not supported, but chances
are that everything still works. If you have to use those, modify ``tox.ini``,
test and run at your own risk ;) Or, you may use older versions of the library.

Installation
------------

In order to install ``pyuploadcare``, simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyuploadcare

or, if you prefer it the old way:

.. code-block:: console

    $ easy_install pyuploadcare


Usage
-----

Core API
^^^^^^^^

You can use pyuploadcare in any Python project. At first you need assign
your project keys to conf object. After that you will be able
to do direct api calls or use api resources::

    import pyuploadcare
    pyuploadcare.conf.pub_key = '<your public key>'
    pyuploadcare.conf.secret = '<your private key>'

Upload single file. ``File.upload`` method can accept file object or URL. Depending of file object size
direct or multipart upload method will be chosen::

    with open('file.txt') as file_object:
        ucare_file: File = File.upload(file_object)


Upload file from url::

    ucare_file: File = File.upload("https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png")

Upload multiple files. Direct upload method is used::

    file1 = open('file1.txt')
    file2 = open('file2.txt')
    ucare_files: List[File] = File.upload_files([file1, file2])

Send single file via multipart upload::

    with open('file.txt') as file_object:
        ucare_file: File = File.upload(file_object)

``File.upload`` method accepts optional callback function to track uploading progress.
Example of using callback function for printing progress::

    >>> def print_progress(info: UploadProgress):
    ...     print(f'{info.done}/{info.total} B')

    >>> # multipart upload is used
    >>> with open('big_file.jpg', 'rb') as fh:
    ...    File.upload(fh, callback=print_progress)
    0/11000000 B
    5242880/11000000 B
    10485760/11000000 B
    11000000/11000000 B

    >>> # upload from url is used
    >>> File.upload("https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png", callback=print_progress)
    32590/32590 B

    >>> # direct upload is used. Callback is called just once after successful upload
    >>> with open('small_file.jpg', 'rb') as fh:
    ...     File.upload(fh, callback=print_progress)
    56780/56780 B

Testing
-------

Besides the `Github Actions`_ we use tox. In order to run tests just:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox
