Simple file uploads for the web are of most importance
for us at `Uploadcare`_. Today, everyone is used to the routine of
allowing users to upload their pics or attach resumes. The routine
covers it all: installing image processing libraries, adjusting permissions,
ensuring servers never go down, and enabling CDN.
Features like uploading from Facebook or manual crop are weighty,
hence rare.
Our goal is to change the status quo.

This library consists of the `Uploadcare`_ API interface. You might also want to check out this `guide`_ as
a starting point.
