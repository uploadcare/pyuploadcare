Installation
============

This part of the documentation covers the installation of PyUploadcare.

.. _install-pip-ref:

Pip
---

Installing pyuploadcare is simple with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyuploadcare

or, if you're into vintage:

.. code-block:: console

    $ easy_install pyuploadcare

.. _install-get-the-code-ref:

Get the Code
------------

PyUploadcare is developed on GitHub. You can clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare.git

After that you can install it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install .


Update to version 2.0
---------------------

Some caveats about migration process from version 1.x to 2.x.

A version 2.0 contains the next breaking changes:

* Now, you should import Django models' fields (e.g ``ImageField``) directly from the ``pyuploadcare.dj.models`` module.

* Changed initializing for the ``FileList`` and ``GroupList`` classes. The ``since`` and ``until`` parameters have been removed. Use combination of ``starting_point`` and ``ordering`` instead.

* The ``ucare list`` CLI command has been renamed to ``ucare list_files``. And, according to the previous change, the ``since`` and ``until`` parameters have been removed. The ``starting_point`` and ordering parameters added.

These last two changes are necessary for working with version 0.5 of REST API.
So that means you canâ€™t use these classes correctly with versions prior 0.5
(but that should not be an issue :)

Also, note that Django configuration option ``UPLOADCARE['widget_variant']``
now is deprecated and it will be removed in next major release. Use
``UPLOADCARE['widget_build']`` instead.

Update to version 3.0
---------------------

Some caveats about migration process from version 2.x to 3.x.

A version 3.0 contains the next breaking changes:

* Resource attributes can be accessed now as properies, not methods.
  In 2.x version use ``file.is_stored()``, in 3.x verisons use ``file.is_stored``.
